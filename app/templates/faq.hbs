    <h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
    <h4>1. How do you come out with this project?</h4>
    <p>We have traveled to Cambodia and witnessed the tough life of the people there, especially the tuk tuk drivers. Some of them have to work for free unlimitely for hotels or guest houses in order to be allowed to pick up possible guests there; some of them are managed by agents and did not have any barging power in terms of rewards; There are a lot of so-called politics in a highly corrupted country. At the same time, these are the people that could be the main earning power of the family, which will support the kids for education etc. We hope to make them rewarded fairly for their work through our efforts.</p>

    <h4>2. Is the team a pure NGO or is there any commercial business model?</h4>
    <p>We are working on it volunteerly with our time and compulsory hardware investment. The goal of this project is to help the tourism service providers there, and creates convenience for the global travelers as well. All information is public and we do not intend to have any commercial business model right now. But we are planing to have some crowd funding in the future to cover the cost of hardware and ground activities in Cambodia. We could turn it into a social enterprise (NGO that does not rely on donations to operate) if public feedback will drive us there, as running a goodwill project purely on donations does not sound cool for us.</p>  

    <h4>3. How are the current major team members working in this project?</h4>
    <p>For now, we utilize our time at weekday nights and weekend to work on this project. All of us have regular work or study to fulfill, but we are commited to work on this meangingful project. It is also a lot of fun to lean from each other with different skill set. You can visit <a href="/our-team">Our Team</a> for more information.</p>


    <h4>4. Why the focus is tuk tuk and taxi drivers there?</h4>
    <p>As tuk tuk are one of most popular and necessary transportation in Cambodia for tourists, tuk tuk drivers are also the ones that are in the low end of the country in the tourism service industry, that are suffered from low income and unfair working conditions. From our conversation with the drivers and insider witnesses there, some tuk tuk drivers have to work for free for hotels or guesthouses in order to be allowed to take jobs from the guests there; and some tuk tuk drivers are being monopolized by agents with unfair conditions. On the other hand, tuk tuk drivers are not very Internet savvy so access to travellers are nearly impossible. What's more, a lot of travelers found it is hard to find a good driver that could take them around Cambodia.</p>
